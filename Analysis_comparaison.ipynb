    "##### Different architectures and parameters were tried, with little (around +- 3%) impact on performance. As long as we stay within reasonable ranges of course (no very high learning rate or just 1 layer of 4 perceptrons, etc...). This tells us that most of the performance variability comes from the number and quality of the features. As such, the frequency features did especially well, needing only 4 features to achieve an accuracy of 57%. The time domain performed the best, but needed 8 features. A correlation analysis was not performed so it is unclear whether some features can be safely ignored with minimal loss in accuracy. The wavelet performed very poorly at 36%. "
