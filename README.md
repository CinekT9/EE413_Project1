This project is about classifing the digits (0-9) using features extracted from audio signals. The audio signals come from the Jakobovski free-spoken-digit-dataset (https://github.com/Jakobovski/free-spoken-digit-dataset). Three models were developed based on three feature extraction methods: Time-domain features, Frequency-domain features, Wavelet features. There are three ipynb files for feature extraction, and three ipyn files for classifiers. So each method has an extraction file and a classifier file. Finally, there is an ipynb file with text-only to analyse and compare the three models.
